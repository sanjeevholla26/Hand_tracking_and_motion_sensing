### Problems faced

I would always looks at the problems that arrise while implemeting a project. So in this project, there are 2 main things, *Hand gesture recognition* and performing *mouse actions* based on the hand gesture that is recognized. So now the potential issues were, 
- If I am designing a website for this, then the mouse actions would be just curtailed to that browser tab only. 
- So just a website wont work. Since I require the mouse action functionality to work everywhere in the laptop (Even though he/she is offline).
- So I have to design a desktop application which when ran, performs mouse actions based on the hand gesture recognized.
